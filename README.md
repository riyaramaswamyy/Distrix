Distrix is an app I created to help my neighbor's business. She mentioned that her distributors send her inventory spreadsheets in different and disorganized formats,
so the data is hard to comprehend and centralize. I wanted to help, so I created created a program that allows users to upload distributor spreadsheets and automatically
summarizes the data into order quantities based on customer, city, and distributor.
